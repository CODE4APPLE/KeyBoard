# KeyBoard
Keyboard handling code contains (deal with input line of text more highly unstable bug) and coreData encapsulation support multithreading,
By (self.keyBoard = [[LYKeyBoardView alloc]initDelegate:self superView:self.view];)
A code you can have a full keyboard. This code encapsulation want to download, you can directly to your project,
I don't need to modify too much content.
